# Password Generator for Stream Deck

This plugin for Elgatos **Stream Deck** is used to generate a new password with a simple press of a button. The generated password is then copied to the clipboard for you to jus paste it somewhere. 

> Isn't that awesome!

Currently the password generator is very simple. I generates a `12` character long password, where each character is chosen from a list of available characters. These inlcude lower and upper case letters, as well as numbers and special characters. See here:

> 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#$%^&*()ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Hopefully the plugin will get some configuration options in order to set these options:
- Length of the password
- Which chunks of characters you want (uppercase letter, lowercase letter, numbers, special characters, ...).
